class TestProvider(BaseProvider, TestLLM):
    """
    A test model provider implementation for developers to build from. A model
    provider inherits from 2 classes: 1) the `BaseProvider` class from
    `jupyter_ai`, and 2) an LLM class from `langchain`, i.e. a class inheriting
    from `LLM` or `BaseChatModel`.

    Any custom model first requires a `langchain` LLM class implementation.
    Please import one from `langchain`, or refer to the `langchain` docs for
    instructions on how to write your own. We offer an example in `./llm.py` for
    testing.

    To create a custom model provider from an existing `langchain`
    implementation, developers should edit this class' declaration to

    ```
    class TestModelProvider(BaseProvider, <langchain-llm-class>):
        ...
    ```

    Developers should fill in each of the below required class attributes.
    As the implementation is provided by the inherited LLM class, developers
    generally don't need to implement any methods. See the built-in
    implementations in `jupyter_ai_magics.providers.py` for further reference.

    The provider is made available to Jupyter AI by the entry point declared in
    `pyproject.toml`. If this class or parent module is renamed, make sure the
    update the entry point there as well.
