"""
This module provides the lists of chat and embedding models available in
LiteLLM.

The source of this module is defined in `jupyter_ai_magics` because that package
needs to be installable without `jupyter_ai`. Therefore, the source has to be
defined in `jupyter_ai_magics.model_list` for now.

In the future, we may provide a shared `jupyter_ai_models` package that provides
the model list, allowing `jupyter_ai` and `jupyter_ai_magics` to be mutually
independent.
