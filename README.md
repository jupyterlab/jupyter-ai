# Jupyter AI

Welcome to Jupyter AI, which brings generative AI to Jupyter. Jupyter AI provides a user-friendly 
and powerful way to explore generative AI models in notebooks and improve your productivity
in JupyterLab and the Jupyter Notebook. More specifically, Jupyter AI offers:

* An `%%ai` magic that turns the Jupyter notebook into a reproducible generative AI playground.
  This works anywhere the IPython kernel runs (JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VSCode, etc.).
* A native chat UI in JupyterLab that enables you to work with generative AI as a conversational assistant.
* Support for a wide range of generative model providers and models
  (AI21, Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, OpenAI, SageMaker, etc.).

Documentation is available on [ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Installation

You can use `conda` or `pip` to install Jupyter AI. If you're using macOS on an Apple Silicon-based Mac (M1, M1 Pro, M2, etc.), we strongly recommend using `conda`.

Because of Ray's incompatibility with Python 3.11, you must use Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10 with Jupyter AI. The instructions below presume that you are using Python 3.10.

Before you can use Jupyter AI, you will need to install any packages and set environment variables with API keys for the model providers that you will use. See [our documentation](https://jupyter-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/index.html) for details about what you'll need.

### With pip

If you want to install both the `%%ai` magic and the JupyterLab extension, you can run:

    $ pip install jupyter_ai

If you are not using JupyterLab and you only want to install the Jupyter AI `%%ai` magic, you can run:

    $ pip install jupyter_ai_magics


### With conda

First, install [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and create an environment that uses Python 3.10:

    $ conda create -n jupyter-ai python=3.10
    $ conda activate jupyter-ai
    $ pip install jupyter_ai

If you are using an Apple Silicon-based Mac (M1, M1 Pro, M2, etc.), you need to uninstall the `pip` provided version of `grpcio` and install the version provided by `conda` instead.

    $ pip uninstall grpcio; conda install grpcio 

If you are not using JupyterLab and you only want to install the Jupyter AI `%%ai` magic, skip the `pip install jupyter_ai` step above, and instead, run:

    $ pip install jupyter_ai_magics


## The `%%ai` magic command

The `%%ai` magic works anywhere the IPython kernel runs (JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VSCode, etc.).

Once you have installed the `%%ai` magic, you can enable it in any notebook or the IPython shell by running:
    %load_ext jupyter_ai_magics

Or

    %load_ext jupyter_ai

Then you can use the `%%ai` magic command to specify a model and natural language prompt:

Jupyter AI can also generate HTML and math to be rendered as cell output.

Jupyter AI can interpolate IPython expressions, allowing you to run prompts
that include variable values.

## JupyterLab extension

The Jupyter AI extension for JupyterLab offers a native UI that enables multiple users
to chat with the Jupyter AI conversational assistant. If you have JupyterLab instaled,
this should be installed and activated when you install the `jupyter_ai` package.

## Using
